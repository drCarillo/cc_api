# cc_api

Overview:

#Task 1

# With this information create a script (using any language you feel most comfortable in) that queries the API for funded status loans, e.g. http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/search.json?status=funded
NOTE: I did not use any frameworks or IDE for development or testing: just wrote out of a text editor.

File: /libs/KivaLoanApiExample.class.php: class for object to make API calls and process using storage layer
taking advantage of injection/composition for a db storage layer.
File: DbStorage.class.php: PDO db layer.

File: /libs/KivaLoanApiExample.class.php
Specific method call: curlKivaFundedLoansApi($kiva_api_url).
Generic curl method: curlKivaApis($kiva_api_url) - used by all API call methods.

#Choose a loan from the list and pull its information, e.g. http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/300000.json
File: /libs/KivaLoanApiExample.class.php
Method: curlKivaCurrentLoanDetailsApi()

#Then, also pull a list of that loanâ€™s lenders, e.g http://api.kivaws.org/v1/loans/300000/lenders.json
File: /libs/KivaLoanApiExample.class.php
Method: curlKivaCurrentLoanLendersApi()

NOTE: some lenders were Anonymous and didn't have a lender_id in its array of data.
This is an issue and we did not have time to discuss so I didn't address it but it will cause
issue creating a lender repayment schedule and lender repayments since there is no lender_id for
proper db records and foreign keys.


#Task 2

#Use the loan information you gathered above ( e.g:  "loan_amount":100 (in USD), "repayment_term":7 (in months)) to build out a loan repayment schedule into a database table.  
File: /libs/KivaLoanApiExample.class.php
Method: createFundedLoanRecord()
Table: loans

#Then use the list of lenders and determine an estimated repayment schedule for each one. Create a database schema to hold this information and a script that distributes the repayments equally across the lenders. This creates an audit trail that each lender received back the amount they put into the loan.
File: /libs/KivaLoanApiExample.class.php
Method: createFundedLoanLendersRepaymentScheduleRecord()
Table: loan_lender_repayments_schedule

#Then use the list of lenders and determine an estimated repayment schedule for each one. Create a database schema to hold this information and a script that distributes the repayments equally across the lenders. This creates an audit trail that each lender received back the amount they put into the loan.
NOTE: There were no payments_schedule for the loan. So I took the loan amount and divied it by the number
of lenders presuming one payment made (expected_payment_amount (repayment)) on or before expected_payment_date (posted_date + repayment_terms).
Then I take the posted date (presume when clock starts for borrower) and added the months from repayment_terms as the repayment expected date.
File: /libs/KivaLoanApiExample.class.php
Method: createFundedLoanLendersRepaymentRecord()
Table: loan_lender_repayments

#Then, write unit tests for the code as well as an integrity test for the data that ensures each lender got back their expected amount over the course of the loan.
